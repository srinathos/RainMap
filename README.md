# RainMap

This is the Android component of my final year undergrad project: Real - time rain mapping.
The project model approximates the intensity of rainfall at a particular location by calculating the attenuation experienced by microwaves over a reagion. This android applicaion makes this information available to the public. 

Note: This project is not a live model. It was demonstrated over a sample data set and over a fixed region.
